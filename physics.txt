An entangled ionizing UV photon on a doped amethyst, the electronic ground state of the defect is excited to a higher energy state that can be used for a quantum transistor in a lattice that can be measured for conductivity.
When particles travelling at relativistic velocity suddenly collide with stationary objects they lose spatial identification properties. In the double slit experiment, observation repackages the photon with identification properties.
