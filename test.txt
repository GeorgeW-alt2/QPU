can you find the approx optimal path if i give the number 126

cities = 8  # Using 8 fixed cities
    distances = [
        [0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40],
        [10, 0, 35, 25, 30, 20, 15, 45],
        [15, 35, 0, 30, 20, 25, 40, 15],
        [20, 25, 30, 0, 15, 40, 35, 20],
        [25, 30, 20, 15, 0, 35, 20, 25],
        [30, 20, 25, 40, 35, 0, 15, 30],
        [35, 15, 40, 35, 20, 15, 0, 25],
        [40, 45, 15, 20, 25, 30, 25, 0]
    ] 

The approximate optimal path is:

Route: [6 → 5 → 1 → 0 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 4 → 6]
Total Distance: 130

This route starts at city 6 and follows the sequence of cities as listed, returning to city 6 at the end. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or details! ​
