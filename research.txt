The double slit blocks the wave and allows the photon, this wave information is restored when the photon changes it's properties passing through another object. The photon's history erases once the properties are restored, as if it was measured before it left the double slit. The two ends are instantly correlated i.e measurements at either end will result in a final result, no matter how far apart the ends are, for differentation measurement...
