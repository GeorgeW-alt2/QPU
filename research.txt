QPU research - George Wagenknecht - 2025:
Consider the two-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator in a minimal uncertainty state. it's just a localized wave packet centred at the origin. If one now deepens the well a little, the zero-energy wave function inside the well is almost identical to that of this very low energy bound state. For the potential to be localized, a good approximation to the function depends on how rapidly the function changes. To get an idea of what goes wrong when a function is not "smooth", it is important to compare the approximation with a classical pendulum, one oscillating with fixed amplitude and observed many times at random intervals. These states, used with care, are in fact reliable and efficient tools for analyzing quantum mechanical problems.
